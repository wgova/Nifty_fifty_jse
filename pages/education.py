        **What it is:** Total value of all shares = Share Price √ó Number of Shares

        **Buffett's Take:** "Size matters - but only when combined with quality. A big company selling at R1 might be worth less than a small one at R100."
        """)

        st.markdown("""
        **What it is:** Share Price √∑ Earnings Per Share

        **Buffett's Take:** "The higher the P/E, the more faith you need. And I'm a believer in numbers, not fairy tales."

        - Below 15: Might be undervalued
        - 15-25: Fairly valued
        - Above 25: Better have a good growth story!

    with st.expander("Price/Book Ratio"):

        **What it is:** Share Price √∑ Book Value Per Share

        **Buffett's Take:** "Buy companies for less than they're worth. But remember, some assets are worth more than the books show, and some aren't worth the paper they're printed on."

    # Market Sentiment

        st.markdown("""
        **Bullish Indicators** üëç
        - Rising prices and increasing volume
        - Strong earnings growth
        - Positive industry trends
        - High institutional buying
        - Growing market share

        **What it means:** Investors expect prices to rise. Like a bull attacking upward with its horns!

        **Bearish Indicators** üëé
        - Falling prices with high volume
        - Declining earnings
        - Industry headwinds
        - Institutional selling
        - Loss of market share

        **What it means:** Investors expect prices to fall. Like a bear swiping downward with its paw!

        **Neutral Stance** üòê
        - Sideways price movement
        - Mixed signals
        - Unclear market direction

        **Buffett's Take:** "Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful. But always do your homework before taking a stance!"

        **What it is:** Annual Dividend √∑ Share Price √ó 100

        **Buffett's Take:** "If you need the dividend to live on, you probably shouldn't own stocks. But if a company can grow AND pay dividends, now that's interesting."

        - Below 2%: Growth focused
        - 2-6%: Balanced
        - Above 6%: High yield (but check if it's sustainable!)

    with st.expander("Dividend Growth"):

        **What it is:** % Change in Dividend from Previous Period

        **Buffett's Take:** "A rising dividend is often a sign of a healthy business. But remember, dividends come from earnings, and earnings come from good business."

    # Risk Metrics

    with st.expander("Beta"):
        st.markdown("""
        **What it is:** Stock's volatility compared to the market

        **Buffett's Take:** "If you understand the business, volatility is your friend. Beta is Wall Street's way of measuring risk, but they're looking at the wrong thing."

        - Below 1: Less volatile than market
        - 1: Moves with market
        - Above 1: More volatile than market

        **Buffett's Take:** "Find businesses that can employ large amounts of capital at high rates of return. That's the golden ticket."

        - Below 10%: Might need improvement
        - 10-20%: Solid performance
        - Above 20%: Exceptional (but verify sustainability)
